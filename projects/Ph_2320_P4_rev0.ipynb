        "Something you worry about is that Jorginho has been eating too many Whattaburgers and has been gaining weight. He seems to be unaware that 1 calorie (or cal for short), the amount of work required to increase the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celcius, is 4.184 Joules. He appears to be also blissfully ignorant that the food industry uses the $large$ calorie, which is equal to 1000 (regular) calories (to their credit, sometimes abbreviated as Cal rather than cal). Maybe this is why Jorginho keeps eating those Avocado Bacon Burger Whattameals, which contain 1650 Cal $=$ 1,650,000 cal $\\approx$ 7 million Joules."
